Java Script Refresh can be done with either Java Script or a META tag.
The META tag contains three parts: what to do (refresh), when (in sec), and where (URL).
The single line goes into the <HEAD> part of your <HTML> file.
The Java Script contains two parts: where (location.href) and when (in msec).
The Java Script goes inside the <BODY> tag of your <HTML> file.
